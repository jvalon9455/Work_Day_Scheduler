# Work_Day_Scheduler

## DESCRIPTION

The workday scheduler assignment was designed to test our knowledge using everything we have learned up to date. The newest idea introduced to us was the use of jQuery. After last weeks assignment using JavaScript, this week we took a dive to try and make our code simpler and cleaner using jQuery. 
An example of using jQuery to make it cleaner comapred to vanilla JavaScript are as follows:

JavaScript:
var mainContainer = document.getElementById("container");

jQuery:
var mainContainer = $(".container);

There are many other examples displayed within the javascript code.

## ASSIGNMENT OBJECTIVES

This weeks assignment was to show a user a 9-5 workday planner.

Upon opening the link, the user can see a few things:

-Current Date
![] (Screenshot%20(69).png)

-Time blocks ranging from 9-5
-Text area for notes/errand reminders to be placed
-Save button
-Color coded rows to indicate past, present, and future

After the user has written in their errand, they should be able to refresh the page and have the content saved within that timeblock.
